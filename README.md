# NLayerApp
# Multi-Layered AspNet Architecture
This project is built using .NET with a multi-layered architecture (N-tier architecture). It provides a structured approach for building scalable and maintainable applications. The project follows the principles of Separation of Concerns and Dependency Injection to ensure loose coupling between components.

Architecture Overview
1. N-tier Architecture
The application is built using the N-tier architecture, which consists of the following layers:

Core Layer: Contains core business entities, interfaces, and shared utility functions.
Data Layer: Manages data access and communication with the database.
Service Layer: Implements the application's business logic and coordinates interactions between different layers.
2. Core Layer
The Core layer contains the central business entities and interfaces shared across the application. It serves as the foundation for other layers. This layer should not have any dependencies on other layers, making it independent and reusable.

3. Data Layer
The Data layer is responsible for managing data access and communication with the database. It includes the implementation of the Repository pattern for data access and the Unit of Work pattern to manage transactions.

4. Service Layer
The Service layer contains the application's business logic. It communicates with the Data layer for data retrieval and updates. It should not contain any direct references to the Data layer; instead, it relies on abstractions through interfaces.

5. Generic Repository
The project implements the Generic Repository pattern to achieve data access abstraction and avoid redundant data access code. This pattern allows us to reuse the same data access code for different entities, promoting code reusability.

6. AutoFac
AutoFac is used as the dependency injection container. It helps manage the application's dependencies and allows for loose coupling between components. Dependencies are injected into classes instead of being instantiated within those classes, making the code more maintainable and testable.

7. FluentValidation
FluentValidation is a library used for validating input data and business entities. It provides a fluent API to define validation rules and integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET projects, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

8. Unit of Work
The Unit of Work pattern is implemented to manage transactions and ensure consistency when working with multiple data sources or repositories. It allows for atomic operations and rollback in case of failures.

9. Migration
Database migration is used to manage database schema changes over time. By using migrations, the database can be kept in sync with the application's data model, enabling smooth updates without data loss.

10. Global Error Handling
Global error handling is implemented to catch unhandled exceptions throughout the application. A centralized error handling mechanism ensures a consistent approach to handle exceptions and provides meaningful feedback to users.

11. Action Method Refactoring
To avoid code duplication, common code snippets and functionalities are encapsulated in separate methods or utility classes. This approach reduces the maintenance burden and improves code readability.

12. AutoMapper
AutoMapper is utilized to map objects between different layers, such as mapping database entities to DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and vice versa. This reduces manual mapping efforts and simplifies the transformation process.

13. Entity Framework with N-tier Architecture
Entity Framework is used to interact with the database within the context of a multi-layered architecture. The Data layer encapsulates all database-related operations, ensuring that the business logic in the Service layer remains independent of the data access implementation.

14. Single Response Model in APIs
API endpoints return a single response model to provide a consistent structure for data returned from the server. This approach simplifies client-side handling and reduces the risk of leaking sensitive information. The benefits include easier maintenance, better versioning support, and improved performance.
