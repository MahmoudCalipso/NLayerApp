# NLayerApp - Multi-Layered AspNet Architecture
This project is a .NET application showcasing a multi-layered architecture (N-tier architecture) for building scalable and maintainable applications. It follows the principles of Separation of Concerns and Dependency Injection to achieve loose coupling between components.

## Architecture Overview
The application is structured using the N-tier architecture, consisting of the following layers:

## Core Layer
Contains core business entities, interfaces, and shared utility functions. This layer is designed to be independent and reusable, forming the foundation for other layers.

## Data Layer
Manages data access and communication with the database. It employs the Repository pattern for data access and the Unit of Work pattern for transaction management.

## Service Layer
Implements the application's business logic and coordinates interactions between different layers. It relies on abstractions through interfaces and avoids direct references to the Data layer.

## Key Features
→ **Generic Repository:** Achieves data access abstraction and code reusability by using a generic repository pattern.

→ **AutoFac:** Utilizes AutoFac as the dependency injection container to manage dependencies and promote loose coupling.

→ **FluentValidation:** Employs FluentValidation to validate input data and business entities, ensuring data integrity.

→ **Unit of Work:** Implements the Unit of Work pattern for transaction management and consistency across data sources.

→ **Migration:** Uses database migration to manage schema changes over time, ensuring smooth updates without data loss.

→ **Global Error Handling:** Implements centralized error handling for consistent exception management.

→ **Action Method Refactoring:** Encapsulates common code snippets and functionalities to avoid duplication and improve code readability.

→ **AutoMapper:** Utilizes AutoMapper for object mapping between layers, reducing manual mapping efforts.

→ Entity Framework with N-tier Architecture: Uses Entity Framework for database interaction, with Data layer encapsulating all database-related operations.

→ Single Response Model in APIs: API endpoints return a single response model for a consistent data structure and improved performance.

→ Enjoy exploring the NLayerApp and leverage its multi-layered architecture to build robust applications!
